## 2. System Summary

Grocery List Manager (GLM) is a simple Android application for managing grocery lists.  Multiple lists can be maintained by adding items and deleting items.  Users can mark items using a check box to indicate the item has been purchased.  Users can reuse grocery lists by clearing all check boxes.
